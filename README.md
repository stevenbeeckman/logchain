# LogChain
Would it make sense to store logs on a blockchain?

This project is an implementation based on [this article](https://medium.com/programmers-blockchain/create-simple-blockchain-java-tutorial-from-scratch-6eeed3cb03fa).

## Technical details
This is a Spring Boot 2.1.1 starter project using Spring Web, JPA, REST Repositories and REST Docs as dependencies.

To make it work with JPA an H2 in-memory database is included. Read more about Spring and H2 in [this article](http://www.springboottutorial.com/spring-boot-and-h2-in-memory-database).
